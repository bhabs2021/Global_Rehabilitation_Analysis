# Global Rehabilitation Needs Analysis Using Power BI

## Overview
This repository explores global rehabilitation needs using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study (1990–2019). The analysis leverages Power BI to visualise the prevalence, impact, and trends of rehabilitation-related health conditions, supporting efforts to strengthen healthcare systems.

## Dataset Source
The dataset originates from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and contains information on 25 health conditions amenable to rehabilitation. These conditions span across musculoskeletal, neurological, sensory, mental, respiratory, cardiovascular, and neoplasm-related disorders.

## Objectives
Visualise disease burden trends affecting rehabilitation services 
Identify key rehabilitation needs across global populations 
Analyse disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to guide health policy decisions
Provide interactive Power BI dashboards for stakeholders
